# Spectral imaging

Code samples prepared for a talk at the ENS de Lyon, about spectral graph theory. This repository contains a few examples about how to filter images using a neighbourhood graph.

In order to compute efficiently eigenvalues and eigenvectors of laplacian operators, [Graph Tool](graph-tool.skewed.de) was chosen. See [http://graph-tool.skewed.de/download](http://graph-tool.skewed.de/download) for compilation and installation.

SciPy and NumPy are also needed, and PrettyPlotlib is an optional dependency.
